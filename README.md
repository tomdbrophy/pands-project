# Background
The Iris Dataset is a dataset published by R.A. Fisher in 1936 [^1] . The data has been widely used for studying statistics and machine learning.

The iris dataset contains measurements on three species of iris flowers. The measurements are:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

All measurements were taken in cm. In addition to the 4 measurements, the data also records the species of each entry.
There are a total of 150 data entries in the database. This is made up of 50 entries per species.
